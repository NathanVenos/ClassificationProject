# Secondary Market Analysis for LEGOs
We sought to classify whether a given LEGO set will retain its inflation-adjusted value over time, affording the owner the ability to enjoy the product and eventually sell it in the secondary market at cost or for a profit, so they can sustain their hobby while continually purchase new sets.

Data on approximately 3,800 sets was sourced from brickset.com and kaggle.com. Features were engineered from parts data to predict whether a set is currently worth as much or more than it original purchase price. The final prediction accuracy was 81.3% using an XGBoost model.
